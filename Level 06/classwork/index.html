<h1>Information about BMW M4 F82 </h1>



<img src="bmwm4competition.jpg">



<p>
  The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series 
  automobile developed by BMW's motorsport
  division, BMW M, that has been built since 2014.
  As part of the renumbering that splits the coupé 
  and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series,
  the M4 replaced those variants of the 
  BMW M3. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an 
  upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, 
  brakes and weight 
  reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, 
  such as on the roof of the car.
